# Spfx Application Customiser sample using Bing Search API

## Summary
This sample shows how to use the Bing Search API (Cognitive Services) to get news article related with the current page. That relation is set using the value of a specific Managed metadata field in the page. We are searching news articles in the UK market, so the possible _category_ values are listed here:
  * Business
  * Entertainment
  * Health
  * Politics
  * ScienceAndTechnology
  * Sports
  * UK
  * World

You can find the supported categories per market in this link: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices-bingsearch/bing-news-api-v7-reference#news-categories-by-market](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices-bingsearch/bing-news-api-v7-reference#news-categories-by-market)

  * Business
  * Entertainment
  * Health
  * Politics
  * ScienceAndTechnology
  * Sports
  * UK
  * World

## Features

Sample SharePoint Framework application customiser calling the Cognitive Services Bing Search API and bringing back related news articles based in a value in a page field.

This sample illustrates the following concepts on top of the SharePoint Framework:

* using REST API and spHttpClient to get a field of the current page
* using Bing News Search API to get news articles for a specific market and category
* using async / await for the async calls
* using different office fabric UI components like Panel or ProgressBar

## Roadmap
* refactoring in more small components
* for demo purposes, currently is calling the API when the page is loaded. Future versions will call the API only when the button is pressed
